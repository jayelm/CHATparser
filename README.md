Chatparse
==========

This is a Ruby script designed to parse and convert files in the [CHAT
Transcription format](http://childes.talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.pdf) of natural
language conversations, most commonly used in the CHILDES (Child Language Data
Exchange System) corpus at CMU (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/).

Currently, chatparse is under active development, and will first support
conversion from CHAT to YAML formats and back.

Other formats are planned, such as JSON and XML.
